# Equation Writer
There will be a couple things this program can do. One of them is that it could take something like “[ (x + y/2 - sqrt(z)+5^17)--35 ]” and turn it into something more readable like “{ [x + (y / 2) - √(z) + 5¹⁷] - [-35] }”. Another thing it would be able to do would be turn the redone format into an image, so it looks even nicer, and the other thing this program will be able to do will be that it will be able to swap out brackets and such, which will be most useful for programmers. For example, let’s say you have something like “int x = (y + (z / 5) - ((w/v) / (u/5)))”. This can get increasingly confusing to the programmer, so if they write it with brackets, such as “int x = (y + [z / 5] - [{w/v} / {u/5}])”, as you can see, it’s a lot easier to read, as well as much easier to be sure all the parentheticals are there. So if you feed something like the latter into the program, you could have it output a reformat with only parentheses, or vice versa.
